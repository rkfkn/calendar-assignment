Calendar assignment

Task: calendar of office hours

The office hours are: on even days in the morning from 8 am to 2 pm (break 11-1:30 am) and on odd days in the afternoon from 1 pm to 7 pm (break from 4 pm to 4:30 pm). The office is closed on weekends, except on even Saturdays from 8 am to 2 pm (break 11-11: 30).

Yout task is to create a component for displaying and selecting available appointments in the weekly calendar. The calendar is fixed, and the start date is tomorrow.

The calendar should be marked with different colors of your choice: available and reserved appointments, break time and time when the office is not working.

Appointments last 30 minutes. It is possible to choose a maximum of 2 appointments per week, and up to 1 appointment per day.

Also, it is necessary to pre-generate 15 random appointments and mark them on the calendar as busy. The random appointments must also follow the rule stated above.
